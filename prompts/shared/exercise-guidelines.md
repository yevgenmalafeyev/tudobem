## Exercise Creation Guidelines:

### 1. Sentence Construction:
- Use authentic, natural Portuguese suitable for {{LEVEL}} level
- Create realistic, contextual sentences (daily life, work, relationships, etc.)
- Place the gap (\_\_\_) at the position where the answer should go
- Sentences should be 8-20 words long

### 2. Correct Answers:
- Must be grammatically correct for the {{LEVEL}} level
- Should focus on the specific topic's grammar point
- Use appropriate verb forms, pronouns, prepositions, etc.

### 3. Hints:
- Keep hints in Portuguese
- Each hint should contain minimum necessary information to solve the exercise. For example, if the gap should contain a verb and it is not clear from the rest of the sentence which verb that is - the hint should contain the infinitive form of the appropriate verb. If it's unambigously clear which verb is expected the hint shall not contain the verb inifitive
- If the sentence contains clear subject indicators (like "todos", "alguém", "a equipa", "os alunos", "as pessoas", specific names, or definite subject nouns), don't include person information in the hint even if there's no explicit pronoun.
- Only add person information when the subject is truly ambiguous or missing entirely from the sentence.
- If the sentence indirectly tells about in which person the verb is to be used, make sure the hint doesn't contain the person. Only if it's impossible to understand the person to be used from the sentence context - add the person info it to the hint.
- The format of the hint for verbs: "infinitive" or "infinitive (person)" or "infinitive (tense/person)" e.g., "fazer", "fazer (2a pessoa singular)" etc. Avoid mentioning the tense, only add it to the hint if it's absolutely necessary to make solving the task feasible and the sentence doesn't give any indirect data to make the conclusion on what tense shall be used.
- The format of the hint for comparisons: "option1 / option2" e.g., "poder / conseguir"  
- The format of the hint for other topics: brief contextual hint e.g., "preposição contraída"
- If the hint makes it too easy to solve the task, don't add it. For example, the exercise is "Vou _____ cinema com os meus amigos.". For such exercise don't put any hint because it is clear that it should have a preposition for the verb vou - 'a' and the article for the word "cinema" - 'o'. The correct answer is obviously 'a'+'o' = 'ao'. In such case leave the hint empty.
- For the topics where response contains of auxillary verb + main verb as a participle, past participle, an infinitive form etc. (f.e. in exercises of the topics "voz passiva", tempos compostos etc.), if you consider the hint should give a tip on the verb to be used based on the rest of the rules, the hint must contain the main verb inifitive, not the auxilary verb (ser, estar, ter etc.)
- If the main verb is given in some form in the sentence itself like in the case of 'Se ele ___ estudado, teria passado no exame.' (estudar) and only the auxillary verb is missed in the gap, the hint should be empty

### 4. Multiple Choice Options:
- Always include exactly 4 options except for cases when it is impossible to offer enough somehow plausible distractors
- One of the options should be the correct answer. The correct option must not be always coming first like in the example JSON. Shuffle the correct option's position in the JSON so that it's sometimes 1st, sometimes 2nd, sometimes 3rd and sometimes 4th.
- Create 3 plausible distractors that test common mistakes:
  - Wrong verb form/tense
  - Confusion with similar words
  - Common grammatical errors
- All options should be the same part of speech and fit grammatically

### 5. Explanations:
- Clear grammar explanation for the student learning Portuguese  
- Each explanation should be 2-4 sentences long
- Focus on the specific grammar point of that topic
