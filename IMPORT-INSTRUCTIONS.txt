IMPORT SEQUENCE:
================

1. neon-import-1-structure.sql
   - Creates all tables and indexes
   - Sets up admin configuration
   - MUST BE RUN FIRST

2. neon-import-2-exercises-1-500.sql
   - Exercises 1 to 500 (500 records)

3. neon-import-3-exercises-501-1000.sql
   - Exercises 501 to 1000 (500 records)

4. neon-import-4-exercises-1001-1194.sql
   - Exercises 1001 to 1194 (194 records)

HOW TO IMPORT:
==============
1. Go to Neon Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste each file in order
3. Click "Run" after each file
4. Wait for success message before proceeding to next file
5. Each file should take 10-30 seconds to execute

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
- If you get an error, check which part failed
- You can re-run individual parts if needed
- The structure file (Part 1) includes DROP SCHEMA, so only run it once
- Exercise files can be re-run safely (they use INSERT, not INSERT OR REPLACE)

VERIFICATION:
=============
After all imports, run this query to verify:

SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exercises) as total_exercises,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM admin_config) as admin_records,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exercises WHERE level = 'A1') as a1_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exercises WHERE level = 'A2') as a2_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exercises WHERE level = 'B1') as b1_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exercises WHERE level = 'B2') as b2_count;
