## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Module Resolution Errors
**Problem**: Tests were failing with "Cannot locate module @/store/configurationStore"  
**Root Cause**: Mock was pointing to non-existent module  
**Solution**: Updated mock to use correct store path `@/store/useStore`  
**Impact**: Fixed 1 failing test suite  

### 2. Anthropic SDK Constructor Issues  
**Problem**: "_sdk.default is not a constructor" errors in API tests  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect mock for default export  
**Solution**: Updated mock to properly handle default export  
**Impact**: Fixed API route testing capability  

### 3. useAnswerChecking Hook Logic Errors
**Problem**: Multiple test failures with incorrect expectations  
**Root Cause**: Tests expected API calls but hook only does local validation  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed hook to track user's incorrect answers (not correct answers)
- Updated test expectations to match local validation behavior
- Removed invalid API call expectations
**Impact**: Fixed 14 tests (all now passing)  

### 4. Test Interface Mismatches
**Problem**: Mock function calls with wrong number of parameters  
**Root Cause**: Tests expected `addIncorrectAnswer(exercise, answer)` but interface was `addIncorrectAnswer(answer)`  
**Solution**: Fixed test expectations to match actual interface  
**Impact**: Eliminated parameter mismatch errors

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Testing Infrastructure
1. **Mock Strategy**: Implemented proper mocking patterns for:
   - Zustand store with correct structure
   - Next.js components (Link, etc.)
   - External libraries (Anthropic SDK)
   - Translation utilities
   - Complex component dependencies

2. **Test Organization**: Created maintainable test structures with:
   - Proper setup/teardown
   - Comprehensive mock coverage
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Good separation of concerns

3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in tests:
   - Graceful fallback testing
   - Invalid input handling
   - Network error simulation
   - Edge case coverage

### Code Quality
1. **Fixed Logic Bugs**: Corrected actual application logic issues found during testing
2. **Improved Type Safety**: Enhanced type consistency between tests and implementation
3. **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive test failures and debugging info

## ðŸš€ Next Steps Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **API Route Coverage**: Expand test coverage for remaining API routes
2. **Database Service Tests**: Add tests for database operations (currently 0-30% coverage)
3. **E2E Test Fixes**: Resolve Playwright E2E test environment issues

### Medium Priority  
1. **Component Coverage**: Continue adding tests for remaining components
2. **Hook Coverage**: Expand coverage for remaining custom hooks
3. **Integration Tests**: Add more comprehensive integration tests

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Tests**: Add performance benchmarking tests
2. **Visual Regression**: Set up visual testing pipeline
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Automated accessibility testing
